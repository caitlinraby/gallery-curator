# virtual-gallery-curator

Virtual Gallery Curator App created for my Phase 1 Portfolio Project using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

This app allows the user to interact with the Met API (using JS fetch & JSON), allowing users to search for over 2 million works in the Metâ€™s collection, and then save them to a personal curated virtual gallery on the page. They then have the option to remove works from their gallery using the "x" button.
